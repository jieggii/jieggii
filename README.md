# Hi there and welcome to my profile!
[![committers.top badge](https://user-badge.committers.top/finland_private/jieggii.svg)](https://user-badge.committers.top/finland_private/jieggii)

I enjoy building things, breaking things, and figuring out how they work.

I have a really diverse range of interests, so it's simpler to have them displayed as a couple of pie charts...

## What I am into right now
This pie chart shows the topics I'm actively exploring

```mermaid
pie title I am currently exploring...
    "25% Math & Physics" : 25
    "15% Business & entrepreneurship" : 15
    "15% Astronomy" : 15
    "12% Software architecture" : 12
    "10% Backend developement (mostly Go/Python)" : 10
    "05% Crypto" : 5
    "05% Satellite signal monitoring" : 5
    "05% Embedded systems" : 5
    "03% DevOps, Deployment and Infra" : 3
    "05% Cryptography" : 20
```

> [!NOTE]
> The percentages reflect my current curiosity level, not my expertise. And of course, they're just rough estimates.

## Topics I'm eager to start exploring
Topics I'm excited about but haven't had time to dig into yet

```mermaid
pie title I am eager to start exploring...
    "29% Radioastronomy": 29
    "29% Quantum computing" : 29
    "25% Machine learning" : 25
    "17% Custom mechanical keyboards" : 17
```

> [!NOTE]
> Same here - the percentages are just my curiocity level.
