# jieggii's profile readme 🐈 

I really enjoy coding, mainly do it for my pet and study projects, work hard everyday to expand my knowlege. I'm also keen on GNU/Linux distros, tiling window managers, various CLI and TUI programs and other nerdy stuff. Always happy to try and learn something new.

I speak English (~B2), Finnish (~B1) and Russian (native).

## My field of interests
I have a diverse range of interests, and right now, I'm particularly enthusiastic about:

- Backend development (mostly in Go and Python)
- GNU/Linux administration
- Machine learning
- Electronics & embeded development
- Crypto
- Cryptography
 
I'm also actively seeking job/internship opportunities and paid projects. If you think I can contribute to your project or team, don't hesitate to reach out! (>w<)
