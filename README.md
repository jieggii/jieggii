# Hi :)

## A little info about me
I really enjoy coding, mainly do it for my very few pet-projects.
I'm also keen on GNU/Linux distros and tiling window managers.
Always like to learn something new.

## Experience
I've been into programming for around 4 years already but 
I see that I'm only in the beginning of my way to this charming world.
